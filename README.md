<h1> ALX-Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming</h1>

<p>This repository contains programs produced for the ALX-SE School's low-level programming and algorithm course. I will be learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming ideas while working in the C language in these projects, which will take place across the Year 1 curriculum. The following is a detailed list of projects completed thus far:</p>

<ul>
<li>0x00. C - Hello, World</li>
<li>0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while</li>
<li>0x02. C - Functions, nested loops</li>
<li>0x03. C - Debugging</li>
<li>0x04. C - More Functions Nested Loops</li>
<li>0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings</li>
<li>0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings</li>
<li>0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings</li>
<li>0x08. C - Recursion</li>
<li>0x09. C - Static libraries</li>
</ul>
