<h1>C - Pointers, arrays and strings Project</h1>
<p>This project taught me about pointers and arrays, how to utilize them, and the differences between them. In addition, I learnt how to work with strings in C programming, including how to use and alter them.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>0. 98 Battery st. - C function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.</li>
<li>1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream - C function that swaps the value of two integers.</li>
<li>2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read - C function that returns the length of a string.</li>
<li>3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them - C function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
</li>
<li>4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear - C function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.</li>
<li>5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes - C function that reverses a string.</li>
<li>6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true - C function that prints every other character of a string, followed by a new line.</li>
<li>7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half - C function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line.</li>
<li>8. Arrays are not pointers -  C function that prints an input n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.</li>
<li>9. strcpy - C function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.</li>
<li>10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers - C function that converts a string to an integer without using long, new variable arrays, or hard-coded special values, as follows:
The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters. Takes into account all + and - signs before the number. If there are no numbers in the string, the function returns 0.
</li>
<li>11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code - C program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.</li>
</ul>
