<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>
0. isupper -  C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns 1 if the character is uppercase, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>1. isdigit - C function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). Returns 1 if the character is a digit, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>2. Collaboration is multiplication -  C function that multiplies two integers. Returns the value of the multiplication.</p>

<p>3. The numbers speak for themselves - C function that prints the numbers 0 to 9, followed by a new line.</p>

<p>4. I believe in numbers and signs - C function that prints the numbers 0 to 9 except for 2 and 4, followed by a new line.</p>

<p>5. Numbers constitute the only universal language - C function that prints the numbers 0 to 14, followed by a new line, ten times.</p>

<p>6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line - C function that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character _ followed by a new line. </P>
<p>7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe - C function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the \ character, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch - C function that prints a square using the # character, followed by a new line.</p>
<p> 9. Fizz-Buzz - C program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, Fizz is printed instead of the number, for multiples of five, Buzz, and for multiples of both three and five, FizzBuzz.</p>
<p>10. Triangles - C function that prints a triangle using the # character, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic - C program that prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - C function that prints an integer without using long, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.</p>
