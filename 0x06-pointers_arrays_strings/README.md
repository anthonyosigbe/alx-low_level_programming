<h1>C - More pointers, arrays and strings Project</h1>

<p>I continued to practice utilizing pointers, arrays, and strings in C in this project.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p><0. strcat - C function that concatenates two strings.</p>
<p>1. strncat -  C function that concatenates two strings using at most an inputted number of bytes.</p>
<p>2. strncpy - C function that copies a string, including the terminating null byte, using at most an inputted number of bytes.</p>
<p>3. strcmp - C function that compares two strings</p>
<p>4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy - C function that reverses the content of an array of integers.</p>
<p>5. Always look up - C function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.</p>
<p>6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes - C function that capitalizes all words of a string.
</p>
<p>7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody - C function that encodes a string into 1337, without switch or ternary operations and using only one if and two loops.</p>
<p>8. rot13 - C function that encodes a string to rot13, without switch or ternary operations and using only one if and two loops.</p>
<p>9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - C function that prints an integer without using long, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.</p>
<p>10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work - C program that prints a[2] = 98 using pointer magic.</p>
<p>11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art - C function that adds two numbers stored in strings to a buffer.
Assumes that strings are never empty and that numbers will always be positive, or 0.</p>
<p>12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls -  C function that prints the content of an inputted number of bytes from a buffer.</p>
