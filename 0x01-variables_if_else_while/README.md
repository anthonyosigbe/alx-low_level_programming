<h1>C PROGRAMMING  Variables, if, else, while Tasks</h1>
<p>I gained knowledge of C's arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators with this project. I also worked on utilizing while loops, if and if...else statements, and declaring and creating variables of type char, int, and unsigned int. </p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing - C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line

1. The last digit - 1-last_digit.c: C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game - C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off - C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times.

4. alphABET - C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters q and e, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.

5. Numbers - C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6. Numberz - C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice without any variables of type char.

7. Smile in the mirror - C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.

8. Hexadecimal - C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times.

9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success - C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the putchar function exactly four times without any variables of type char.

10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need - C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do... C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

12. Software is eating the World - C  program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
