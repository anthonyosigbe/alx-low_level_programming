<h1>C PROGRAMMING 0x00. C - Hello, World Tasks</h1>
This project taught me about gcc compilation, main entry points, and text-printing routines in C.

<h3> TASKS CARRIED OUT</h3>
0-preprocessor - Bash script that executes the preprocessor on a C file stored in the variable $CFILE and writes the outcome to the file c.

1. Compiler - A Bash script that compiles a non-linked C file stored in the variable $CFILE and saves the outcome in an output file with the same name but a .o extension.

2. Assembler - A Bash script that converts the C code stored in the variable $CFILE into assembly code and stores the finished product with the same name but a .s extension.

3. Name - Bash Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable $CFILE and creates an executable cisfun

4. Hello, puts - program that outputs exactly "Programming is like putting together a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line using the function puts.

5. Hello, printf -  C program that prints exactly with proper grammer, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line, using the function printf.

6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation - A C program that compiles and runs on a computer and outputs the sizes of various kinds.

7. Intel -  Script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a .s extension.
Example: If the C file is main.c, the output is main.s.


8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity - C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error, without using any functions listed in the NAME sesction of the man(3) printf or man(3) puts.
