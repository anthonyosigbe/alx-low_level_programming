<h1>C - Bit manipulation Project</h1>
<p>Throughout the duration of this project, I delved into the fascinating world of bitwise manipulation in the C programming language. Over the course of my journey, I acquired comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in dealing with individual bits, effectively harnessing the power of fundamental bitwise operators, namely the right shift (>>), left shift (<<), bitwise AND (&), bitwise OR (|), and bitwise XOR (^). This newfound expertise enabled me to perform intricate bitwise operations, paving the way for more efficient and optimized solutions in my coding endeavors.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
0. 0 - nction that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.<br>The parameter b is a pointer to a string of 0 and 1 characters.<br>If b is NULL or there are one or more characters in b that are not 0 or 1 - returns 0.<br>Otherwise - returns the converted number.<br>

1. 1 - C function that prints the binary representation of a number.<br>

2. 10 - C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.<br>Indices start at 0.<br>If an error occurs - returns -1.<br>Otherwise - returns the value of the bit at the given index.<br>

3. 11 - C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.<br>If an error occurs - returns -1.<br>Otherwise - returns 1.<br>

4. 100 - C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.<br>If an error occurs - returns -1.<br>Otherwise - returns 1.<br>

5. 101 - C function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.<br>

6. Endianness - C function that checks the endianness.<br>If big-endian - returns 0.<br>
If little-endian - returns 1.<br>

7. Crackme3 - File containing the password for the crackme3 executable.<br>
